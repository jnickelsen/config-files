<h1>RMOO 1.1</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>RMOO is a MOO client for Emacs. In addition to the basic
features present in any MOO client, RMOO includes more advanced
features, mainly the ability to edit MOO notes, mail, and code in
separate Emacs buffers and to easily send these buffers back to the
MOO. RMOO also includes support for the <a href= 
"http://cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/emacspeak/">Emacspeak</a> audio
desktop, so that people who are blind and use Emacspeak can more
easily use MOOs and other similar servers.</p>

<p>You can always find the latest version of RMOO, along with
pre-built Red Hat packages, at the <a href= 
"http://www.pobox.com/~mattcampbell/rmoo.html">RMOO home
page</a>.</p>

<h2>Release History</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Version 1.1 (released October 18, 2000)</dt>

<dd>
<p>This is a maintenance release. In this release, I removed the
activity alert that Emacspeak users used to get while they were
typing in an RMOO buffer, because it caused problems with Emacs
20.5 and later. I also updated everything to reflect my new email
address and Web site address. Finally, I quit using Latte and now
write the HTML code myself.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Version 1.0 (released January 17, 2000)</dt>

<dd>
<p>This is a <em>major</em> release, and a lot has changed. I
reworked the installation procedure to make it more like the
standard procedure for Emacs packages and open-source software in
general. I also improved support for Emacspeak and fixed other
miscellaneous problems. In particular, I added special sounds that
RMOO uses when running in conjunction with Emacspeak. I got them
from a collection of <a href= 
"http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Lot/4847/cow.html">cow
sounds</a> that I found on the Web. I hope they will make your
MOOing experience more fun.</p>
</dd>

<dt>May 26, 1999</dt>

<dd>
<p>In local editing, I added two new commands: C-c C-c now uploads
the current buffer to the MOO and destroys the window, and C-c C-]
destroys the window without uploading the buffer.</p>
</dd>

<dt>May 23, 1999</dt>

<dd>
<p>There is a new variable, <code>rmoo-send-always-goto-end</code>,
which, if set to <code>t</code>, will make RMOO always go to the
end of the buffer after sending a line, no matter where in the
buffer the user was.</p>
</dd>

<dt>March 21, 1999</dt>

<dd>
<p>In this release, I have one specific goal: to make the RMOO
extension for Emacspeak consistently notify the user of activity in
a MOO buffer which is not his current buffer, and to make it
consistently read that activity to the user when he switches to the
MOO buffer. I believe I have achieved this goal.</p>
</dd>

<dt>March 1, 1999</dt>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a typo in the installation section of the README.</li>

<li>Improved Emacspeak support with the help of <a href= 
"http://cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/">T. V. Raman</a>.</li>

<li>Fixed C-c C-q command to provide reasonable feedback after
disconnecting from the MOO.</li>

<li>Added this "Release History" section to the README file.</li>

<li>Converted this README file to <a href="http://www.latte.org">
Latte</a>, the Language for Transforming Text. Latte's primary use
now is to generate HTML, and that is why I am using it. <a href= 
"http://lynx.browser.org">Lynx</a> is now used to generate the
plain-text version of this document. I am also using <a href= 
"http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy">HTML Tidy</a> to keep the
generated markup clean.</li>

<li>Put the files in this package under RCS control, with the
exception of the README and README.html files which are generated
from the Latte source.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>February 20, 1999</dt>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>New unofficial maintainer.</li>

<li>Added support for the Emacspeak audio desktop and fixed a bug
in the process.</li>

<li>Moved default RMOO directory from ~/emacs/rmoo to ~/rmoo for
easier installation.</li>

<li>Updated installation and W3 sections in the README.</li>

<li>Added "Introduction" and "Getting Started" sections.</li>

<li>Finally, this package is now in a tar.gz file instead of an
uncompressed tar file.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>October 9, 1994</dt>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>To use RMOO, you should have <a href= 
"http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a> version 20 or
later. I have not tested RMOO with XEmacs recently, though it may
work. To take advantage of some features of the MOO Client Protocol
(MCP), you will need <a href= 
"http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/docs.html">Emacs/W3</a> as
well.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>To install RMOO from the source package, follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Unpack the rmoo-1.1.tar.gz file.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Change to the new RMOO source directory (rmoo-1.1) and type the
following commands as any user:</p>

<p><kbd>./configure</kbd><br>
<kbd>make</kbd></p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Now, as root, type this while in the RMOO source directory:
<kbd>make install</kbd></p>
</li>

<li>Add the following line to your .emacs file or your
/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-start.el file: 

<p><code>(require 'rmoo-autoload)</code></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also get a Red Hat package that is ready to install and
use from the <a href=
"http://www.pobox.com/~mattcampbell/rmoo.html">RMOO home
page</a>.</p>

<h3>Upgrading from pre-1.0 versions of RMOO</h3>

<p>For users of RMOO versions before 1.0, you need to do a little
preparation before installing the new version. When you installed
an older version of RMOO, you had to add a block of code from a
file called fragment-of-.emacs to your .emacs file. You must now
remove this code, because it has moved into the main RMOO code.
This block started with the following:</p>

<pre>
;;
;; Change this if you want to keep the rmoo source somewhere else.
;;
</pre>

<p>and ended with the following:</p>

<pre>
(rmoo-load-libs)
</pre>

<p>Once you have removed this block, you can continue with the
normal RMOO installation procedure. At this point, you will not
have the shortcut key (<kbd>C-c m</kbd>) that you used to use to
start RMOO. TO get this back, refer to the Tips and Tricks
section.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Once you have installed RMOO using the instructions provided
above, you can connect to a MOO any time by pressing <kbd>M-x
rmoo</kbd>. When you are prompted for a MOO world, you can either
enter one, optionally using Emacs's completion facility to help
you, or you can press Enter without entering anything. If you do
the latter, you will be prompted for the site and port, in addition
to login name and password.</p>

<h3>World List Basics</h3>

<p>To add a new MOO world, type <kbd>M-x
rmoo-worlds-add-new-moo</kbd>, and follow the prompts. Then save
the world list by typing <kbd>M-x rmoo-worlds-save</kbd>.</p>

<h2>Local Editing</h2>

<p>One of the great benefits of RMOO is the ability to edit MOO
mail, code, or other text in a standard Emacs buffer, with all of
the editing commands available. This is a great improvement over
the primitive line editor provided by most MOOs. To turn on local
editing on a standard LambdaCore-based MOO, type:</p>

<p><kbd>@edit-options +local</kbd></p>

<p>A new Emacs buffer will now be opened when you want to edit
something on the MOO. RMOO provides instructions for sending the
text to the MOO or closing the window without sending.</p>

<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>

<p>If you have trouble with RMOO leaving the point at the end of
the line you just sent, you may find it helpful to add the
following to your .emacs file:</p>

<p><code>(setq rmoo-send-always-goto-end t)</code></p>

<p>This will cause RMOO to always go to the end of the buffer after
sending a line. You can also configure RMOO so that it will not
send your input to the server unless you are on the last line of
the buffer. This is helpful for Emacspeak users who review the MOO
buffer with the cursor movement keys, and then start typing without
going to the end of the buffer. To turn on this feature, add this
to your .emacs file:</p>

<p><code>(setq rmoo-send-require-last-line t)</code></p>

<p>You may find it helpful to have a shortcut key that you can use
to start RMOO. To add this feature, add the following to your
.emacs file:</p>

<p><code>(global-set-key "\C-cm" 'rmoo)</code></p>

<p>You can now start RMOO with <code>C-c m</code>.</p>

<p>Enjoy,<br>
