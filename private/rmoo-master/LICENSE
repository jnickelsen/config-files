The following is an email I received from Ron Tapia, original author
of RMOO, when I contacted him regarding my modifications to the code.
I'm treating this as the license for RMOO, since he didn't give it a
formal license (like GPL or BSD).  The message is unedited, including
a quotation of my original message, which explains my motivation for
taking on this project.  In keeping with Ron's request, I have been
using the Revision Control System (RCS) to track my changes to the
code.  The RCS logs are at the bottom of the source files.

Hi,

I haven't been actively working on rmoo (or MOO'ing for that matter) for
several years.

You are welcome to extend the code however you like. All that I ask is
that it be made reasonably clear in the source (and anywhere else
appropriate) what code I wrote and what code/changes you're responsible
for. 

Cheers,

Ron
